<h2>CS414: Video/ Audio Streaming</h2>

<p> 
An implemetation of video-on-demand-service that streams video/audio content from one machine to another machine through connected network. The media server is able to stream video.audio to multiple clients concurrently. 
</p> 

<h3>Design and algorithm</h3>
<p>Each client in our video/audio system composed of three threads, the GUI thread, the control communication thread, and video/audio streaming thread. As there is no GUI requirement for the server, the server only has control communication thread and video audio streaming thread. The difference is that the client only need one streaming thread, however, the server may have several streaming threads (each thread takes care of one client).</p>

<p> The GUI part is in charge of the user interface and controls the communication thread to let client and server communicate with each other. These communication include reservation, QoS negotiation, and video operation command, such as, Play, fast forwardâ€¦</p>
